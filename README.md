### 🧑‍💻 About Me

Former sales manager turned backend developer with real-world experience in Django, Django REST Framework, and PostgreSQL. Built and deployed multiple apps, including a Stripe-integrated library system and a Telegram-notified task manager. Comfortable with Docker, CI/CD, and writing clean, scalable code. Known for strong communication, fast learning, and getting things done — whether it’s leading a team or solving messy bugs at 3AM.
